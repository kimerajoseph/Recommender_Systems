# RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
This repo is about building recommeder systems for different purposes. The two types represented here are:

1. Clustering. Group items into cluster and recommend them according to these clusters. When a customer/website
visitor clicks on an item, you recommend similar items from the clicked item's cluster

check the recommender_with_classification folder above

2. User based collaborative filtering. Used if you have information about the user. If a user watched certain movies,
we find users that watched similar movies. Find moview that our user has not yet watched , but were watched by other 
similar users. Build a correlation between our random user and other users. Get user with the highest correlation
with our randome user, get movies they watched and recommend them

Chekout the user_based_collborative_recommender_systems folder above for more details
